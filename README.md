## Physics with JavaScript simulations


### Background

This repo consists of a collection of classical mechanics models from physics. The models(with the exception of two_masses_with_springs example) consist of models for which the equations of motion were solved using [Lagrangian_mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics). Since the equations are a set of Differential equations [Eulers Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) was used for numerical integration to generate solutions.




### Architecture, Technologies, Math and Physics



This project implementes the following technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript and `jquery` for overall structure and logic,
- `HTML5 Canvas` for DOM manipulation and rendering
- Physics: Lagrangian Mechanics
- Math: Differential Equations, and Euler Method
